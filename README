Game rankings

Implement a ranking program using the Elo ranking algorithm.

Given two files:

names, where each line has an ID number and a name for said ID
matches, where each line contains the ID of the two players of a match and the first one is the winner of said match.



Implement a program that can read both files and then:

* Score each player based on the games played
* Generate a list of players sorted by score, their ranking (position in the list) and their number of wins and losses.
* Generate a report for each person, showing with whom they played and how they fared.
* Generate a list of suggested next matches.



Implementation notes:

You can choose how to implement the different functionalities for the program.
You may choose to implement it as a command line
1. parameter (e.g. "./elo names matches show_ranking", "elo names matches show_rank USER_NAME", etc).
2. Try to keep the output format independent of the main application logic (ie design it so that it is possible to add
new output formats if needed).
